Who is Hamid?
- I have been working in design and animation for more than 3 years now. Yes, I still love when I design create human-centered design which not only look beautiful but work well and I love giving it a life by micro-animation.

- I love the idea of how small designs decisions can have huge impace on overall user experience of the products.

- I'm currently enrolled in Bachelors of Information Technology from Virtual University of Pakistan.

- I'm starting to learn to code because I think as a designer it's better for me to learn it so I can work and intergrate with developers more efficiently and provide my insights too!

- Starting from this CS50-Repository, I'm placing building blocks for my technology career ahead!
